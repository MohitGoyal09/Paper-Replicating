# Paper-Replicating

A repository dedicated to implementing various machine learning research papers from scratch using PyTorch.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to deepen understanding of machine learning algorithms and architectures by:

- Implementing foundational research papers from scratch
- Using PyTorch as the primary framework
- Achieving at least one benchmark metric mentioned in each paper
- Thoroughly documenting the implementation process

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **AutoEncoders/** - Implementation of various autoencoder architectures
- **RNN/** - Recurrent Neural Network paper implementations
- **CNN/** - Convolutional Neural Network paper implementations

## 🔍 Implementation Approach

Each paper implementation follows this methodology:

1. **Paper Analysis** - Thorough understanding of the research paper
2. **Architecture Design** - Recreating the model architecture using PyTorch
3. **Training Pipeline** - Building efficient training and evaluation pipelines
4. **Metric Validation** - Validating against at least one metric from the paper
5. **Documentation** - Comprehensive documentation including:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Implementation challenges
   - Solutions and insights
   - Performance analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **PyTorch** - Primary deep learning framework
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Jupyter Notebooks** - For interactive experimentation and visualization

## 📊 Implementations

Each implementation directory contains:

- Source code for the model
- Training scripts
- Evaluation metrics
- Documentation of results and learnings
- References to the original paper

## 🔜 Future Work

- Expanding to more paper categories (Transformers, GANs, etc.)
- Comparative analysis between different implementations
- Performance optimization techniques

## 📚 References

Each implementation includes references to the original papers being replicated.
